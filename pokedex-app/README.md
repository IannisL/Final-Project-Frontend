# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

 Hi!, I'm Iannis and ...This is My Pokedex app project!
I love pokemon Hint my PFP....And Have played many of the games through out the series and really just wanted to make my Pokefan girl dream come true!
Pokemon Diamond was my first game ever and such a beloved one even after the remasterd version was made like a year ago! and Watched the series all the way to the end and saw our boy become WORLD CHAMPION! 

In this project I used React, CSS, JavaScript, Axios, and Mongoose! This project is my baby and will be even more invovated with more up dates listed below!:
Plans for App's Future:

Add a second region of pokedex

add shiny variants to first region pokedex

add legendarys for gen 1-2

add pvp with a set team of pokemon

add a favorites page for user's

add a friend's list for users

add a sign out for users

This project was done within a week and will become a staple to my future as a software egineer! It also includes a back end that stores the data and pokemon info! If you want to visit and see my Schema or Crud or anything else I did back there here's the link!

Thanks to Abraham E.Tavarez and Colton Wright of Perscholas for putting up with me and teaching me everthing they could! Thanks to them I was able to make this beauty over here! 


These are the outside resources that I used in my Project for code and reference and Ideas for my pages and pokedex over all!
