           <p> "Hi!, I'm Iannis and ...This is My Pokedex app project!
I love pokemon Hint my PFP....And Have played many of the games through out the series and really just wanted to make my Pokefan girl dream come true!
Pokemon Diamond was my first game ever and such a beloved one even after the remasterd version was made like a year ago! and Watched the series all the way to the end and saw our boy become WORLD CHAMPION! 

In this project I used React, CSS, JavaScript, Axios, and Mongoose! This project is my baby and will be even more invovated with more up dates listed below!:
Plans for App's Future:

Add a second region of pokedex

add shiny variants to first region pokedex

add legendarys for gen 1-2

add pvp with a set team of pokemon

add a favorites page for user's

add a friend's list for users

add a sign out for users

This project was done within a week and will become a staple to my future as a software egineer! It also includes a back end that stores the data and pokemon info! If you want to visit and see my Schema or Crud or anything else I did back there here's the link!
